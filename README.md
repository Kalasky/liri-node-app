**WHAT IS LIRI?**

>Hey, Liri here. I access API's to search for your favorite movies, bands, artists, and songs. I also provide users with extra detail such as the album the song is from, a preview link of the song, movie ratings, movie plots, venue dates and locations of your favorite artists/bands and much more!
